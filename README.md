###Description:

Bloom is a library for set reconciliation based on invertible bloom filters (IBF). Instead of transmitting all the keys between 2 peers, an IBF can be used to recover the set difference. The key component is in determining the appropriate size of the IBF, which is accomplished using either a strata, min wise or hybrid estimator.
